A little bit about me ..

* DevOps Engineer -> Lots of knowledge about large complex systems
* Writer -> Notes
* Reader -> Books, Articles, Podcasts ...

Components of my system:

* Obsidian -> Central place where everything comes together
* Google Keep -> Quickly capture something when I only have my phone
* Readwise -> Highlights from books and Articles
* Kindle -> Reading books and making highlights/Notes
* Reader -> App by readwise to store and read articles from the web and make highlights / take Notes
