# Introduction

In this series of articles I want to invite you to follow me on my journey through Goolge Summer of Code.
I hope to make a post every two weeks that details what I learned, what progress I made and which challenges I came across.
In this first opener to the series, I want to give an overview over what Google Summer of Code is, why I applied for it and
