I'm a CS Student and software developer with a focus on infrastructure, automation and security.\
I believe that these three should really go hand in hand with each other.
As your infrastructure grows larger you will inevitable need to start automating things and when you start automating things, you will need to integrate security into your automation.

There is something about computers communicating that simply fascinates me, wether that's two entirely different systems talking to each other or one large distributed system where multiple maschines need to communicate to work as one.
When sending data over a network there is just so much that can go wrong, yet we managed to build (somewhat) reliable systems around all these uncertainties, how could I not find that fascinating?
