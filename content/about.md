# Hey, I'm Marius.

I work as a Software Engineer and focus on automation, infrastructure and security.\
Officially, my current job title is "DevOps Engineer". I am currently working with\
and learning about AWS and Terraform while also coding in Go. \
I enjoy learning about new technologies and experimenting with them as it helps me 
to stay sharp and get out of my comfort zone. One of my favourite quotes is "If you are
running the ministry of hammers every problem looks like a nail" which perfectly relates to
using the same known technologies for everything.\
I also contribute to open-source, In 2022 I participated in [Google Summer Of Code][GSoC] during
which I made [a major contribution][blog] to [CoreDNS][coredns].
